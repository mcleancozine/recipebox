A project to help me learn Rust.

The goal is to create an application that stores recipes. Users should be able to search recipes by ingredient, name, origin, and more.

Eventually, I would like to turn this into a web application, using Rust crates for PostgreSQL, asynchronous servers, and more, in order to learn about those things as well. If I get to that stage of the project, I would also like to learn Svelte for the web frontend.

As a starting point, I am going to design a CLI that takes and stores a recipe name, origin, and list of ingredient names. Users should then be able to search their stored recipes by name, origin, or ingredient. 

Design decisions:
- Using clap crate for command line parsing due to its popularity

Todo/think about:
clean all user input
